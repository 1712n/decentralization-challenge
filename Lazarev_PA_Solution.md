Task: Evaluate the level of decentralization in a crypto project via comparing 3 crypthocurrencies:
	Litecoin
	Bitcoin
	Dogecoin

General information: Decentralizations - parameter that shows us the gratitude of reliability of blockchain. 
	Decentralizations, for examle - how much does blockchain have different nodes. Also we could understand decentralization as 
	ability of blockchain's net to resist attacks and etc.

GitHub metrics:
	Count of GitHub pull-requests:					
		Litecoin: 10
		Bitcoin 303
		Dogecoin: 66

	Release year:			
		Litecoin: 2011
		Bitcoin 2009
		Dogecoin: 2013

	Average count of Pull-request per year:			
		Litecoin: 0,833333333
		Bitcoin: 21,64285714
		Dogecoin: 6,6

	Conclusion: Generally that metric shows us how blockchain community is involved into project. 
	Bitcoin has the biggest number of pull-requests per year. Obviously, Bitcoin has bigger gratitude of decentralization and seems more reliable.						


An Investigation of cost 51%-attack:						
	To provide 51%-attack, it`s necessarily to control over 50% of blockchains`s  hashrate
	
	Total blockchain`s hasrate EH/s:			
		Litecoin: 0,00078267
		Bitcoin: 346,17
		Dogecoin: 0,00097893

	51% blockchain`s hashrate, EH/s:			
		Litecoin: 0,000399162
		Bitcoin: 176,5467
		Dogecoin: 0,000499254

	Choosing Miner for cryptho-mining:			
		Litecoin: Bitmain Antminer L7
		Bitcoin: Bitmain Antminer S19 XP
		Dogecoin: Bitmain Antminer L7

	Cost of Miner, $			
		Litecoin: 18500
		Bitcoin: 18000
		Dogecoin: 18500
	
	One Miner`s performance, EH/s			
		Litecoin: 9,5E-12
		Bitcoin: 0,0001
		Dogecoin: 9,5E-12

	Miners count required for 51% - attack:		
		Litecoin: 42017021,05
		Bitcoin: 1765467
		Dogecoin: 52553084,21

	Cost of 51%-attack, billions $:		
		Litecoin: 777,31
		Bitcoin: 31,78
		Dogecoin: 972,23
	  	  	  
	Conclusion: according to result, Bitcoin is more weakly for 51%-attack because its miners costs cheaply than for another blockchains. 
		To get more accurated results, we also need to calculate cost of energy

				
Market capitalization, billions $			
		Litecoin: 21 039
		Bitcoin: 53 554
		Dogecoin: 7 992

	Conclusion: as more total capitalization of blockchain, as it`s more decentralized because it`s harder to control all coins
		As we see, bitcoin is more reliable and decentralized, but for more complex evaluation, we need to undestand, how many coins will be mined in future.


Profit analyzing						
	Profit per day, $ (without cost of energy)		
		Litecoin: 0,26
		Bitcoin: 6,18
		Dogecoin: 1,57
			
			
	Period of self-repayment of one miner, days		
		Litecoin: 71153,84615
		Bitcoin: 2912,621359
		Dogecoin: 11783,43949
		- period of self-repayment is so long for one miner. Obviously, it`s much better to union different miners into big farms.

	Conclusion: as we  could see, period of self-repayment is too long for one miner. So we understand that creating business in that 
		sphere is very expensive, but Bitcoin is the fastets way to make money. It means that people with less money will choose 
		bitcoin for mining so number of active nodes will increase so gratitude of decentralization will rise with time.

Government reflection:
	Government reflection to cryptho-industry nowadays is changing. Governments tries to regulate cryptho, and there is no certain understanding of 
	how it will be in future. It could have good effect - for example, with help of decentralization (creating goverment-controlling nodes), 
	but from another side it may have bad consequences, if number of nodes will be bigger than it neaded. To make certain conclusion I need more time 
	for understand goverment intentions		

Result conclusion:						
	As it seems, Bitcoin seems more decentralized cryptho than Dogecoin and Litecoin, but it is the most risky coin under 51%-attack. 
	The most part of danger causes becouse of very productive Bitcoin Miners. Also there is no certain understanding of goverment position about crypthos. 

	But according to information that we have right now, I believe that Bitcoin is the most decentralized (and safety) coin becouse: 
		1. Cheapest production = big number of miners
		2. Active community = safety of coin is permanently increasing
		3. Big market capitalization = big number of users
