# A report assessing different meterics for measuring crypto-currency decentralization:

We will start by defining the meaning of decentralization, there are two most used definitions:

- The opposite of centralization, the situation when there is one central point that has the power to decide the system's status. In this case, the decentralized system has no one point to decide the system’s status at one’s own will, which means that peer-to-peer consensus is required. There is no need to trust anybody, but users can trust the system. In this case the measurement of decentralization is related to the measurement of trusted the system itself is.
- In terms of usage. A decentralized system should provide user privacy and autonomous control of the system.

Prior-assessment criteria include consensus protocols. However, there is there is a limit because, even though systems are designed with good protocols, they can become centralized with time.

To achieve post-evaluation criteria, there is a need for other measurements, these include:

- Total number of nodes participating in the network, as the number of nodes participating increases, the more the system gets centralized.
- The hash power of i-th node, in the case of Proof of Work (PoW) block creation, the hash power determines the probability of the reflection of opinion of each node, as the difference in hash power increases between nodes, the more centralized the system gets.
- The share of the i-th node, in the case of Proof of Stake (PoS) block creation, the share of the stakes determines the probability of the reflection of the opinion of each node, as the difference of share increases between nodes, the more centralized the system gets.
- Total number of validators, in the case of Proof of Stake (PoS) block creation, the more there are validators in the system, the more it gets decentralized.
- The number of countries where nodes in the blockchain are located, generally, the more the nodes are distributed in different countries, the more decentralized the system gets. If most nodes of the network are located in the same country, the availability of that network is not guaranteed and can be dependent on the country’s policies.
- The number of nodes belonging to the country, for the same reasons as the point above.
